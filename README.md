# coloroziation-neural-network
A simple neural network for colorizing black and white images.

This is my first work in the field of neural networks, which was completed as part of a course. Unfortunately, there are many shortcomings and not the most successful solutions that arose due to my limited experience at the time of design. However, despite these shortcomings, the network functions and provides, albeit not ideal, but generally correct results.
To view the results, run model.h5 on the test dataset.
